# COMP9024 Assignment 4

This is the README of COMP9024 Assignment 4

This assignment use a diagram to represent a bus network and implment following functions for the bus network:

```c
int StronglyConnectivity(...);
void maximalStronlyComponents(...);
void reachableStops(...);
void TravelRoute(...);
```
Implementation of the above functions can be found in MyGraph.c

## How to compile and run

This assignment contains several source files written in C so it is necessary to use Makefile to compile the program. Main function is located in test_ass4.c. 

### Compilation
 
Run this command at terminal to compile :
```bash
make test_ass4
```
If compilation is  successful, at terminal you will see:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -O -c test_ass4.c
gcc -Wall -Werror -O -c MyList.c
gcc -Wall -Werror -O -c MyHeap.c
gcc -Wall -Werror -O -c MyGraph.c
gcc -o test_ass4 test_ass4.o MyList.o MyHeap.o MyGraph.o MyList.o
``` 
If compilation is already done before you run ```make```, then at terminal you will see:
```bash
make: `test_ass4` is up to date.
```
### Execution

If compilation is successful, run this command to execute test_ass4 :
```bash
./test_ass4
```
After this command is run, marker can verify the results printed at terminal.
### Clean

Run this command to clean objective files generated by ```make``` :

```bash
make clean
```

If clean is successful, at terminal you will see:

```bash
rm test_ass4 test_ass4.o MyGraph.o MyList.o MyHeap.o
```

If you run ```make clean``` but there is nothing to clean, at terminal you will see:

```bash
rm test_ass4 test_ass4.o MyGraph.o MyList.o MyHeap.o
rm: test_ass4: No such file or directory
rm: test_ass4.o: No such file or directory
rm: MyGraph.o: No such file or directory
rm: MyList.o: No such file or directory
rm: MyHeap.o: No such file or directory
make: *** [clean] Error 1
```
